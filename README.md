This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# RESORT PROJECT

This is my first iteration of creating a react app from scratch with multiple different routes in an e-commerce type fashion. There may be some addition of a transaction API later down the line.

It is important to note that this app has absolutely NO testing framework, this is because I would like to see how the same app differs to another that has been fully tested from the ground up. It will also be important to bear in mind that I will be doing some feature tests as a user otherwise the app will be far harder to complete without any visibility whatsoever.

This website is built in react using JavaScript, JQuery, HTML and CSS and will be deployed on heroku throughout the project (link). As previously mentioned there is no use of a testing suite which means that I will be omitting the use of any kind of CI (continuous integration) i.e. Travis, CircleCI.

### Note on Navbar

I have hard coded the links to 'Home' and 'Rooms' as opposed to creating a constants folder containing these links so that I can prevent repetition. This is because I have no need to put the links anywhere else other than the Navbar itself which will be on every page that the app contains (even the error page).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
